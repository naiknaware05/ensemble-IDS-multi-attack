# Ensemble-IDS-multi-attack
This is our final year engineering project titled "Ensemble Based Intrusion Detection System". In multi attack environment, there would be more than one attack occurring simultaneously or within a short span of time. In our project, we have considered all those attacks as multi attacks which occur within one second of time span. We have proposed a system that captures live packets from the network and classifies whether the packet is normal or belongs to one of the subclasses of attack using various ensemble approaches such as Bagging, Boosting and Stacking. NSL-KDD dataset has been used for both training and testing the model.
